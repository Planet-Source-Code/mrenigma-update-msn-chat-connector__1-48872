## \[Update\] MSN Chat Connector


</div>

### Description

[Updated to include a very basic example of how to connect using this OCX] - As MSN Chat rooms are closing, I feel its time to share the code for this OCX which I use in my Chat Room Manager application I wrote, IRCDominator has been used for years and had recently been updated.

I am releasing the MSN Chat connector OCX I wrote for my latest release of my Chat room manager and Its here for all to view.

Its not well documented but has lots of usefull code. I hope people will find it usefull.

Some of the best parts are the classes I created to hold Chatters information etc.

IRCDominatorXT aint dead yet!! - AG
